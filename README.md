1. RFR-user1 and RFR-user2 are jupyter notebooks containing training results using user1 data and user2 data respectively. These two notebooks can be run, they show the performance metrics. 
2. For predicting March Soil Mosture data, we need the features data (CSV) for March. The format and feature names must be same as in the data given in Problem Statement.
3. These feature data files of March must be kept in the cloned repository.
4. To make predictions for user1 features of March, run estimator_user1, __but please change the name of the feature data file__
5. Step 4 may be repeated for user2 features of March, with estimator_user2. 
6. Predictions will get saved as a csv file (user1_March_predictions.csv, user2_March_predictions.csv), with two columns: ['ttime', 'pred_sm']
